#this is queens, a Golang n queens calculator 

BUILD IT
--------
Assuming your golang environment is properly set up, it's as easy as:
go build queens.go


RUN IT
------

Run it with 

queens -h for  help
queens -s -n=12 to calculate the n=12 case
queens -n=12 for all solutions from n=4 to n=12

queens is written in Golang 1.7 and runs fine on any *nix system. It uses backtracking to find queens. 

It doesn't yet use Golang parallel features for multi-core machines, but it will soon. 

Enjoy!
